# VAST2020
This was a project for a Data Visualizations course, focusing on the 2020 Vast Challenge.

This project was a combination of two Chord Diagrams using the Co-Authorship Data.  
How to read the diagram:  
Looking at the Chord Diagram with all the data.  
If we take a look at the section that shows the percent of people that have 1 Co-Authorship.  
Each ribbon shows the percent of people that have 1 co-authorship with another person that is in another group.  
We see that for people with 1 co-authorship each share a low percentage of people in each other group.  

There is also an animation that gives the user the ability to look at each group individually.
